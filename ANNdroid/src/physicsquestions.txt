Planets do not twinkle because
they emit light of a constant intensity
their distance from the earth does not change with time
they are very far away from the earth resulting in decrease in intensity of light
they are nearer to earth and hence we receive a greater amount of light and, therefore minor variations in the intensity are not noticeable
